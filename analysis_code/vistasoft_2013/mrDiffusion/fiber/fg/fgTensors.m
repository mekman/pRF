function Q = fgTensors(fg,dParms)
%Calculate a tensor for forward modeling at each point of each fiber

%  Q = fgTensors(fgImg,dParms)
%
% Q is a cell array of the same length as the number of fibers
% Each Q{ii} contains a matrix of (numNodes x 9) tensors.
%
% To put the tensor into the quadratic form, use T = reshape(T,3,3);
% eigs(T) calculates the axial diffusivity (largest) and so forth.
%
% Example:
%  d_ad = 1.5; d_rd = 0.3;
%  dParms(1) = d_ad; dParms(2) = d_rd; dParms(3) = d_rd;
%  fgImg.Q = fgTensors(fgImg,dParms)
