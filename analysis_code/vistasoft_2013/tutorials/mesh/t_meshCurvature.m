%   Umin is the direction of minimum curvature
%   Umax is the direction of maximum curvature
%   Cmin is the minimum curvature
%   Cmax is the maximum curvature
%   Cmean=(Cmin+Cmax)/2
%   Cgauss=Cmin*Cmax
%   Normal is the normal to the surface

% BUT, this routine fails a lot.  I wrote the authors.  I put a try/catch
